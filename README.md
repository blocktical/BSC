# SmartContract

BSC stands for Blocktical Solidity Coding where we will learn how to write smart contracts in solidity and will do some hand-on over our learnings. The BSC is divided into two catogaries:
    1. LearnSolidity : Contains all the learning resourses for solidity smart contract writing.
    2. SolidityProjects : Business Case Scenarios of Solidity Smart Contract Implementations.
